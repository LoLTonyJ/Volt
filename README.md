# Volt
Source Code for Volt Network

LAST EDITED - 10/20/2024 (Oct 20th, 2024)


I tried my best at explaining parts of the code that didn't have self explanatory methods. (I.E p.sendMessage())
All the classes are labeled for their purpose, your config file is labeled Config.yml, your Gravestone file is labeled Gravestone.jar.
If there is any questions, or something you don't trust or something you even want to learn about, feel free the contact me and I'll get back to you whenever I can.

If everything looks okay, and we're good to go. Please let me know, and I will get the jar ready and send it.
We may have to use a thirdparty website for downloads, depending how Discord wants to handle this (We can use Spigot if it comes down to it and I can make a private post)
You can also download it from Github Directly, if you look on the right (If you're on PC) I don't know how it is on Mobile.
